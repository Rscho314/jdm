# Rationale
There are a plethora of statistical and data-wrangling tools. However,
all of those want to "look serious" and are therefore geared at "indus-
trial strength" applications. This project takes an alternative view in
that it is specifically aimed at the manipulation of small and irregular
datasets efficiently, in terms of user-time efficiency. Typical applica-
tions would be clinical trials in medicine, or the analysis of any data-
set constituted of non-automated harvested data.

# User story
Start by asking the user for some detail about the dataset (skippable):

- index rows/columns?

# Ideas
- make testing facility
- make utility functions
- choose a metadata format
- memoize the basic structure of the dataset for dplyer-like functionality
- record complete history of data transorms with immediate undo redo
- make every statistic change in real-time
- create a dedicated UI
